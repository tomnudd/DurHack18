DIANETICALLY, THE OPTI MUM individual is called the Clear.
One will hear much of  that word, both as a noun and a verb, in this
volume, so it is well to spend time here at the outset setting forth
exactly what can be called a Clear, the goal of Dianetic therapy.
A Clear can be tested for any and all psychoses, neuroses,
compulsions and repressions (all aberrations) and can be examined for
any autogenic (self-generated) diseases referred to as psychosomatic
ills. These tests confirm the Clear to be entirelywithoutsuch ills or
aberrations. Additional tests of his intelligence indicate it to be high
above the current norm. Observation of  his activity demonstrates
that he pursues existence with vigor and satisfaction.
Further, these results can be obtained on a comparative basis.
A neurotic individual, possessed also of  psychosomatic ills, can be
tested for those aberrations and illnesses, demonstrating that they
exist. He can then be given Dianetic therapy to the end of clearing
these neuroses and ills. FinaII}r, he can be examined, with the above
results. This, in passing, is an experiment which has been performed
many times with invariable results. It is a matter of laboratory test

that all individuals who have organically complete nervous systems
respond in this fashion to Dianetic clearing.
Further, the Clear possesses attributes, fundamental and inherent
but not always available in an uncleared state, which have not been
suspected of Man and are not included in past discussions of  his
abilities and behavior.
First there is the matter of  perceptions. Even so-called normal
people do not always see in full color, hear in full tone, or sense at
the optimum with their organs of smell, taste, tactile and organic
sensation.
These are the main lines of  communication to the finite
world which most people recognize as reality. It is an interesting
commentary that while past observers felt that the facing of reality
was an absolute necessity ifthe aberrated individual wished to be
sane, no definition of how this was to be done was set forth. To face
reality in the present, one would certainly have to be able to sense
it along those channels of  communication most commonly used
by Man in his affairs.
Anyone of Man's perceptions can be aberrated by psychic
derangements which refuse to permit the received sensations to be
realized by the analytical portion of the individual's mind. In other
words, while there may be nothing wrong with the mechanisms
of  color reception, circuits can exist in the mind which delete
color before the consciousness is permitted to see the object.
Colorblindness can be discovered to be relative or in degreesin such
a way that colors appear to be less brilliant, dull or, at the maximum,
entirely absent. Anyone is acquainted with persons to whom "loud"
colors are detestable and with persons who find them insufficiently
"loud" to notice. This varying degree of colorblindness has not been
recognized as a psychic factor, but has been nebulously assumed to
be some sort of a condition of mind when it was noticed at all.
There are those persons to whom noises are quite disturbing, to
whom, for instance, the insistent whine of aviolin is very like having
a brace and bit applied to the eardrum; and there are those to whom

The CLEAR
fifty violins, played loudly, would be soothing; and there are those
who, in the presence of  a violin, express disinterest and boredom;
and, again, there are persons to whom the sound of  a violin, no
matter if it be playing the most intricate melody, is a monotone.
These differences of sonic (hearing) perception have, like color and
other visual errors, been attributed to inherent nature or organic
deficiency or assigned no place at all.
In a like manner, from person to person, smells, tactile sensations,
organic perceptions, pain and gravity vary widely and wildly. A
cursory check around among his friends will demonstrate to a man
that there exist enormous differences of  perception of  identical
stimuli. One smells a turkey in the oven as wonderful, one smells
it with indifference, another may notsmell it at all. And somebody
else may maintain that roasting turkey smells exactly like hair oil,
to be extreme.
Until we obtain Clears, it remains obscure why such differences
should exist. For in the largest measure, such wild quality and
quantity of perception is due to aberration~ Because of  pleasurable
experiences in the past and inherent sensitivity, there will be
some difference among Clears and a Clear response should not
be assumed automatically to be a standardized, adjusted middle
ground, that pallid and obnoxious goal of past doctrines. The Clear
gets a maximum response compatible with his own desire for the
response. Burning cordite still smells dangerous to him, but it does
not make him ill. Roasting turkey smells good to him ifhe is hungry
and likes turkey; at which time itsmells very, very good. Violins play
melodies, not monotones, bring no pain and are enjoyed to a fine
full limit ifthe Clear likes violins as a matter of taste-if he doesn't,
he likes kettledrums, saxophones or, indeed, suiting his mood, no
music at all.
In other words, there are two variables at work. One, the wildest,
is the variable caused by aberrations. The other, and quite rational
and understandable, is caused by the personality.

BOOK ONE a CHAPTER Two
Thus the perceptions of  an aberree'" (non~Cleared individual)
vary greatly from those of the Cleared (unaberrated) individual.
Now there are the differences of the actual organs of perception
and the errors occasioned by these. Some of these errors, aminimum,
are organic: punctured eardrums are not competentsound-recording
mechanisms. The majority of perceptic (sense message) errors in
the organic sphere are caused by psychosomatic errors.
Glasses are seen on noses everywhere around, even on children.
The majority of these spectacles are perched on the face in an effort
to correct a condition which the body itselfis fighting to uncorrect
again. Eyesight, when the stage of glasses is entered (not because of
glasses), is deteriorating on the psychosomatic principle. And this
observation is about asirresponsible as a statement thatwhen apples
fall out of trees, they usually obey gravity. One of the incidental
things which happens to a Clear is that his eyesight, ifit had been
bad as an aberree, generally improves markedly and, with some
slight attention, will recover optimum perception in time. (Far
from an optician's argument against Dianetics, this assures rather
good business, for Clears have been known at treatment's end to
have to bu)', in rapid succession, five pairs of glasses to compensate
adjusting eyesight, and many aberrees Cleared late in life settle
down ocularly at a maximum a little under optimum.)
The eyesight was reduced in the aberree on an organic basis by
his aberrations so that the perceptic organ itselfwas reduced from
optimum operating function. With the removal of  aberrations,
repeated tests have proven that the body makes a valiant effort to
reconstruct back to optimum.
Hearing, in addition to other perceptics, varies organically over a
wide range. Calcium deposits, for instance, can make the ears "ring"
incessantly. The removal of aberrations pennitsthe body to readjust
toward its reachable optimum: the calcium deposit disappears and
the earsstop ringing. Butfar and beyond this veryspecific case, there
..Aberree is a neologism meaning an aberrated person.

The CLEAR
are great differences in hearing on the organic basis. Organically
as well as aberrationally, hearing can become remarkably extended
or closely inhibited so that one person may hear footsteps a block
away as a normal activity and another would not hear a bass drum
thundering on the porch.
That the various perceptions differ widely from individual to
individual on an aberrational and psychosomatic basis is the least of
the discoveries outlined here. Ability to recall is far more fantastic
in its variation from person to person.
An entirely new recall process, which was inherent in the mind
but which had not been noticed, came to light in the process of
observing Clears and aberrees. This recall process is possible in
only a small proportion of aberrees in its fullest sense. It is standard,
however, in a Clear. Naturally, no intimation is made here that the
scholars of  past ages have been unobservant. We are dealing here
with an entirely new and hitherto non-existent object of inspection:
the Clear. What a Clear can do easily, quite a few people have, from
time to time, been partially able to do in the past.
An inherent, not a taught, ability of the remembering mechanisms
of the mind can be termed, as a technical word of Dianetics, returning.
It is used in its dictionary sense, with the addition of the fact that
the mind has it as a normal remembering function as follows: the
person can "send" a portion of his mind to a past period on either a
mental or combined mental and physical basis and can re-experience
incidents which have taken place in his past in the same fashion and
with the same sensations as before. Once upon a time an art known
as hypnotism used what was called "regression" on hypnotized
subjects, the hypnotistsending the subject back in one of two ways
to incidents in his past. This was done with trance techniques, drugs
and considerable technology. The hypnotic subject could be sent
back to a moment "entirely" so that he gave every appearance of
being the age to which he was returned with only the apparent
faculties and recollections he had at that moment: this was called
"revivification" (reliving). "Regression" was a technique by which

BOOK ONE Q CHAPTER Two
part of the individual's selfremained in the present and part went
back to the past. These abilities of the mind were supposed native
only in hypnotism and were used only in hypnotic technique. The
art is very old, tracing back some thousands of years and existing
today in Asia as it has existed, apparently, from the dawn of time.
Returning is substituted for "regression" here because it is not a
comparable thing and because "regression," as a word, hassome bad
meanings which would interrupt its use. Reliving is substituted for
"revivification" in Dianetics because, in Dianetics, the principles
of hypnotism can be found explained and hypnotism is not used in
Dianetic therapy, as will be explained later.
Themind, then, has another ability to remember. Partof the mind
can "return," even when a person is wide awake, and re-experience
past incidents in full. Ifyou want to test this, try it on several people
until one is discovered who does it easily. Wide awake, he can
"return" to moments in his past. Until asked to do so, he probably
will not know he has such an ability. Ifhe had it, he probably thought
everybody could do it (the type of supposition which has kept so
much of this data from coming to light before). He can go back to
a time when he was swimming and swim with full recall of hearing,
sight, taste, smell, organic sensation, tactile, etc.
A "learned" gentleman once spent some hours demonstrating
to a gathering that the recall of a smell as a sensation, for instance,
was quite impossible since "neurology had proven that the
olfactory nerves were not connected to the thalamus." Two
people in the gathering discovered this ability to return and,
despite this evidence, the learned gentleman continued the dispute
that olfactory recall was impossible. A check among the gathering
on this faculty, independent of returning, brought forth the fact
that one-half of  those present remembered a smell by smelling
it again.
Returning is the full performance of imagery recall. The entire
memory is able to make the organ areas re-sense the stimuli in a
past incident. Partial recall is common: not common enough to be


The CLEAR
nonnal, but certainly common enough to have merited considerable
study. For it again is a wide variable.
Perception of the presentwould be one method of facing reality.
But ifone cannot face the reality of the past then, in some part, he
is not facing some portion of reality. And ifit is agreed that facing
reality is desirable, then one would have to face yesterday's reality
as well ifhe were to be considered entirely "sane" by contemporary
definition. To "face yesterday" requires a certain condition of recall
to be available. One would have to be able to remember. But how
many ways are there of remembering?
First there is the return. That is new. It gives the advantage of
examining the moving pictures and othersense perceptions recorded
at the time of the event with all senses present. He can also return
to his past conclusions and imaginings. It is of  considerable aid in
learning, in research, in ordinary living, to be able to be again at
the place where the data desired was first inspected.
Then there are the more usual recalls. Optimum recall is by the
return method of single or multiple senses, the individual himself
remaining in present time. In other words, some people, when they
think of a rose, see one, smell one, feel one. They see in full color,
vividly-with the "mind's eye" to use an old colloquialism. They
smell it vividly. And they can feel it even to the thorns. They are
thinking about roses by actually recalling a rose.
These people, thinking about a ship, would see a specific ship,
feel the motion of her ifthey thought of being aboard her, smell the
pine tar or even less savory odors and hear whatever sounds there
were about her. They would see the ship in full-color motion and
hear it in full-tone audio.
These faculties vary widely in the aberree. Some, when told to
think of  a rose, can merely visualize one. Some can smell one but
not see it. Some see it without color or in very pale color. When
told to think of  a ship, some aberrees only see a flat, colorless, still
picture such as a painting of a ship or the photograph of one. Some
perceive a vessel in motion without color but with sound. Some hear

BOOK ONE Q CHAPTER Two
the sound of a ship butfail to see any picture whatever. Some merely
think of a ship as a concept thatships exist and that they know about
them and fail to see, feel, hear, smell or otherwise sense anything
on a recall basis.
Some past observers have called this "imagery," but the term is
so inapplicable to sound and touch, organic sensation and pain that
recall is used uniformly as the technical Dianetic term. The value
of recall in this business of living has occupied such scant attention
that the entire concept has never been formulated previously. It is
therefore detailed at some length here, as above.
It is quite simple to test recalls. Ifone will ask his fellows what
their abilities are, he will gain a remarkable idea of howwidely varied
this ability is from individual to individual. Some have this recall,
some have that, some have none but operate on concepts of recall
only. And remember, ifyou make a test on those around you, that
any perception is filed in the memory and therefore has a recall
which is to include pain, temperature, rhythm, taste and weight
with the above mentioned sight, sound, tactile and smell.
The Dianetic namesfor these recalls are vido (sight),sonic (sound),
tactile (touch), olfactory (smell), rhythmic, kinesthetic (weight and
motion), somatic (pain), thermal (temperature) and organic (internal
sensations and, by new definition, emotion).
Then there is another set of  mental activities which can be
summated under the headings of imagination and creative i'fllagination.
Here again is abundant material for testing.
Imagination is the recombination of  things one has sensed,
thought or intellectually computed into existence, which do not
necessarily have existence. This is the mind's method of envisioning
desirable goals or forecasting futures. Imagination is extremely
valuable as a part of  essential solutions in any mental problem and
in everyday existence. That it is recombination in no sense deprives
it of its vast and wonderful complexity.
AClear uses imagination in its entirety. There is an imagination
impression forsight, smell, taste, sound-in short, for each one of the


The CLEAR
possible perceptions. These are manufactured impressions on the
basis of models in the memory banks combined by conceptual ideas
and construction. New physical structures, tomorrow in terms of
today, next year in terms of last year, pleasure to be gained, deeds
to be done, accidents to avoid, all these are imaginational functions.
The Clear has full color-visio, tone-sonic, tactile, olfactory,
rhythmic, kinesthetic, thennal and organic imagination in kind.
Asked to envision himselfriding in a gilded coach and four, he "sees"
the equimoving in full color, he "hears" all the noises which
should be present, he "smells" the smells he thinks should be there,
and he "feels" the upholstery, the motion, and the presence in the
coach of  himself.
In addition to standard imagination there is creative imagination.
This is a very wide undimensional ability, quite variable from
individual to individual, possessed in enormous quantity by some. It
is included here, not as a portion of the operation of the mind treated
as a usual part of  Dianetics, but to isolate it as an existing entity.
In a Clear who possessed creative imagination, even ifinhibited, as
an aberree, it is present and demonstrable. It is inherent. It can be
aberrated only by prohibition of its general practice, which is to say,
by aberrating the persistence in its application or encysting the whole
mind. But creative imagination, that possession by which works of
art are done, states built and Man enriched, can be envisioned as a
special function, independent in operation and in no way dependent
for its existence upon an aberrated condition in the individual, since
the examination of its activity in and use by a Clear possessing it
adequately demonstrates its inherent character. It is rarely absent
in any individual.
Finally, there is the last, but most important activity of  the
mind. Man is to be regarded as a sentient being. His sentience
depends upon his ability to resolve problems by perceiving or
creating and understanding situations. This rationality is the
primar}) high-echelon function of that part of the mind which makes
him a Man, not just another animal. Remembering, perceiving,


THE LORD has the signal ability of resolving conclusions and of
using conclusions resolved to resolve further conclusions. This is
rational Man.
Rationality, as divorced from aberration, can be studied in
a Cleared person only. The aberrations of  the aberree give him
the appearance of  irrationality. Though such irrationality may
be given the gentler names of  "eccentricity" or "human error" or
even "personal idiosyncrasJT," it is, nevertheless, irrationality. The
personality does not depend upon how irrationally a man may act.
It is not a personality trait, for instance, to drive while drunk and
kill a child on a crosswalk-or even to risk killing a child by driving
while drunk. Irrationality is simply that: the inability to get right
answers from data.
Now it is a curious thing that although "everybody knows"
(and what a horrible amount of misinformation thatstatement lets
circulate) it is "human to err," the sentient portion of  the mind
which computes the answers to problems and which makes man
Man is 'Utterly incapable of error.
This was a startling discovery when it was made, but it need
not have been. It could have been deduced some time before, for
it is quite simple and easy to understand. The actual computing
ability of Man is never in error, even in a very severely aberrated
person. Observing the activity of such an aberrated person, one
might thoughtlessly suppose that that person's computations were
wrong. But that would be an observer error. Any person, aberrated
or Clear, computes perfectly on the data stored andperceived.
Take any common calculating machine (and the mind is an
exceptionally magnificent instrument far, far superior to any
machine it will invent for ages to come) and put a problem on it
for solution. Multiply  timesIt will answer, properly,Now
multiply  times  but continue to hold down the ;  times  is
but the answer you will get isContinue to hold down  and put
other problems on the machine. They are wrong, not as problems,
but as answers. Now fix  so that itstays down no matter what keys


The CLEAR
are touched and try to give the machine away. Nobody will want it
because, obviously, the machine is crazy. Itsays  times lois .
But is the calculating portion of the machine really wrong or is it
merely being fed the wrong data?
In the same way the human mind, being called upon to resolve
problems of  a magnitude and with enough variables to confound
any mere calculating machine a thousand times an hour, is prey to
incorrect data. Incorrect data gets into the machine. The machine
gives wrong answers. Incorrect data enters the human memory
banks, the person reacts in an "abnormal manner." Essentially, then,
the problem of resolving aberration is the problem of finding a
"held-down ." But of that, much, much more, later. Right now we
have accomplished our immediate ends.
These are the various abilities and activities of the human mind in
its constant task of resolving and putting into solution a multitude of
problems. It perceives, it recalls or returns, it imagines, it conceives
and then resolves. Served by its extensions-the perceptics and
the memory banks and the imaginations-the mind brings forth
answers which are invariably accurate, modified only by observation,
education and viewpoint.
And the basic purposes of that mind and the basic nature of Man,
as discoverable in the Clear, are constructive and good, uniformly
constructive and uniformly good, the solutions modified only by
observation, education and viewpoint.
Manis good.
Take away his basic aberrations and with them go the evil of which
the Scholastic and the Moralist were so fond. The only detachable
portion of  him is the "evil" portion. And when it is detached, his
personality and vigor intensify. And he is glad to see the "evil"
portion go because it was physical pain.
Later, there are experiments and proof s for these things and
they can be measured with the precision so dear to the heart of the
physical scientist.

The Clear, then, is not an "adjusted" person, driven to activity
by his repressions now thoroughly encysted. He is an unrepressed
person, operating on self-determinism. And his abilities to perceive,
recall, return, imagine, create and compute are outlined as we
have seen.
The Clear is the goal in Dianetic therapy, a goal which some
patience and a little study and work can bring about. Any person
can be Cleared unless he has been so unfortunate as to have had
a large portion of his brain removed or to have been born with a
grossly malformed nervous structure.
We have seen the goal of Dianetics here. Let us now inspect the
goal of Man. a


The GOAL of  MAN

THE GOAL of  MAN, the lowest common denominator of all his
activities, the Dynamic Principle of  his Existence, has long been
sought. Should such an answer be discovered, it is inevitable that
from it many answers would flow. Itwould explain all phenomena of
behavior; it would lead toward a solution of Man's major problems;
and, most of all, itshould be workable.
Consider all knowledge to fall above or below a line of
demarcation. Everything above this line is not necessary to the
solution of  Man's aberrations and general shortcomings and is
inexactly known. Such a field of  thought could be considered to
embrace such things as metaphysics and mysticism. Below this line
of  demarcation could be considered to lie the finite universe. All
thingsin the finite universe, whether known or as yet unknown, can
be sensed, experienced or measured. The known data in the finite
universe can be classified as scientific truth when it has been sensed,
experienced and measured. All factors necessary to the resolution
of a science of the mind were found within the finite universe and
were discovered, sensed, measured and experienced, and became
scientific truth. The finite universe contains TIME, SPACE, ENERGY
and LIFE. No other factors were found necessary in the equation.

TIME, SPACE, ENERGY and LIFE have a single denominator
in common. As an analogy, it could be considered that TIME,
SPACE, ENERGY and LIFE began at some point of origin and were
commanded to continue to some nearly infinite destination. They
were told nothing butwhat to do. They obey a single order and that
order is "SURVIVE!"
THE DYNAMIC PRINCIPLE of  EXISTENCE IS SURVIVAL.
The goal of life can be considered to be infinite survival. Man,
as a life form, can be demonstrated to obey in all his actions and
purposes the one command: SURVIVE!
It is not a new thought that Man is surviving. It is a new thought
that Man is motivated only by survival.
That his single goal is survival does not mean that he is the
optimum survival mechanismwhich life has attained orwill develop.
The goal of the dinosaur was also survival and the dinosaur isn't
extant anymore.
Obedience to this command SURVIVE! does not mean that every
attempt to obey is uniformly successful. Changing environment,
mutation, and many other things militate against anyone organism
attaining infallible survival techniques or form.
Life forms change and die as new life forms develop just as
surely as one life organism, lacking immortality in itself, creates
other life organisms, then dies as itself. An excellent method,
should one wish to cause life to survive over a very long period,
would be to establish means by which it could assume many
forms. And death itselfwould be necessary in orderto facilitate the
survival of the life force itself, since only death and decay could
clear away older forms when new changes in the environment
necessitated new forms. Life, as a force existing over a nearly
infinite period, would need a cyclic aspect in its unit organisms
and forms.



The GOAL OrMAN
What would be the optimum survival characteristics of
various life forms? They would have to have various fundamental
characteristics, differing from one species to the next just as one
environment differs from the next.
This is important, since it has been but poorly considered in the
past that a set of survival characteristics in one species would not
be survival characteristics in another.
The methods of survival can be summed under the headings
of  food, protection (defensive and of fensive) and procreation.
There are no existing life forms which lack solutions to these
problems. Every life form errs, one way or another, by holding
a characteristic too long or developing characteristics which
may lead to its extinction. But the developments which bring
about successfulness of  form are far more striking than their
errors. The naturalist and biologist are continuaIly resolving the
characteristics of  this or that life form by discovering that need
rather than whim govern such developments. The hinges of the
clamsheIl, the awesome face on the wings of the butterfly, have
survival value.
Once survivalwas isolated as the onlydynamic* of a life form which
would explain all its activities, it was necessary to study further the
action of survival. And it was discovered that when one considered
pain and pleasure, he had at hand all the necessary ingredients with
which to formulate the action life takes in its effort to survive.
*In order to establish nomenclature in Dianetics which would not be too complex
for the purpose, words normally considered as adjectives or verbs have occasionally
been pressed into service as nouns. This has been done on the valid principle that
existing terminology, meaning so many different things, could not be used by
Dianetics without making it necessary to explain away an old meaning to bring
forth a new. To remove the step of explaining the old meaning and saying then that
one doesn't mean that, thus entangling our communications inextricably, and to
obviate the ancient custom of  compounding ponderous and thundering syllables
from the Greek and Roman tongues, this principle and some others have been
adopted for nomenclature. D)'fltmt-ic is here used as a noun and will so continue to
be used throughout this volume. Somatic, perceptic and some others will be noted,
defined when used.

As will be seen in the accompanying graph," a spectrum of life has
been conceived to span from the zero of death or extinction toward
the infinity of potential immortality. This spectrum was considered
to contain an infinity of lines, extending ladder-like toward the
potential of immortality. Each line, as the ladder mounted, was
spaced a little wider than the last, in a geometric progression.
The thrust of survival is away from death and toward immortalit}r.
The ultimate pain could be conceived as existing just before death
and the ultimate pleasure could be conceived as immortality.
Immortality could be said to have an attractive type of force, and
death a repelling force, in the consideration of the unit organism
or the species. But as survival rises higher and higher toward
immortality, wider and wider spaces are encountered until the gaps
are finitely impossible to bridge. The urge is away from death,
which has a repelling force, and toward immortality; which has an
attracting force; the attracting force is pleasure, the repelling force
is pain.
For the individual, the length of the arrow could be considered
to be at a high potential within the fourth zone. Here the survival
potentialwould be excellentand the individualwould enjoyexistence.
From left to right could be graphed the years.
The urge toward pleasure is dynamic. Pleasure is the reward; and
the seeking of the reward- survival goals- would be a pleasurable
act. And to ensure thatsurvival is accomplished under the mandate
SURVIVE! it seems to have been provided that reduction from a
high potential would bring pain.
Pain is provided to repel the individual from death; pleasure
is provided to call him toward optimum life. The search for and the
attainment of pleasure is notless valid in survival than the avoidance of
pain. In fact, on some observed evidence, pleasure seems to have a
much greater value in the cosmic scheme than pain.

Now it would be well to define what is meant by pleasure aside
from its connection with immortaIit~ The dictionary states that
pleasure is "gratification; agreeable emotions, mental or physical;
transient enjoyment; opposed to pain." Pleasure can be found in
so many things and activities that a catalog of  all the things and
activities Man has, does and may consider pleasurable alone could
round out the definition.
And what do we mean by pain? The dictionary states: "physical
or mental suffering; penalty."
These two definitions, in passing, are demonstrative of  an
intuitive type of  thought which runs through the language. Once
one has a thing which leads to the resolution of  hitherto unsolved
problems, even the dictionaries are found to have "always known it."
Ifwe wished to make this graph for a life-form cycle, it would
be identical except that the value of  the years would be increased to
measure eons. For there is no difference, it seems, except magnitude,
in the scope of the individual and the scope of  the species. This
inference could be drawn even without such remarkable evidence as
the fact that a human being, growing from zygote to adult, evolutes
through all the forms which the whole species is supposed to have
evolved through.
Now there is more in this graph than has been remarked as yet.
The physical and mental state of the individual varies from hour
to hour, day to day, year to year. Therefore, the level of survival
would form either a daily curve or the curve of  a life on a measure
of  hourly or yearly position in the zones. And there would be two
curves made possible by this: the physical curve and the mental
curve. When we get toward the back of the book, the relationships
between these two curves will be found vital and itwiII also be seen
that, ordinarily, a sag in the mental curve will precede a sag in the
physical curve.
The zones, then, can apply to two things: the physical being and
the mental being. Therefore, these four zones can be called zones of
the states of being. If a person is happy mentally, the survival level
°

can be placed in ZoneIfthe person is extremely ill physically, he
might be plotted, on estimation of  his illness, in Zone  or close
to death.
Very unprecise but nevertheless descriptive names have been
assigned to these zones:
Zone  is one of  general happiness and well-being.
Zone  is a level of bearable existence.
Zone  is one of  anger.
Zone  is the zone of  apathy.
These zones can be used as a Tone Scale by which a state of
mind can be graded. Just above death, which is , would be the
lowest mental apathy or lowest level of physical life, .. ATone ,
where the body is fighting physical pain or illness or where the
being is fighting in anger, could be graded from ., which would
be resentment or hostility, through Tone ., which would be a
screaming rage, to a ., which would be merely a quarrelsome
inclination. FromToneto Tone ., there would be an increasing
interest in existence, and so forth.
Itso happensthat the state of physical being ormental being does
not long remain static. Therefore, there are various fluctuations.
In the course of a single day an aberree may run fromto ., up
and down, as a mental being. An accident or illness could cause a
similar fluctuation in a day.
These are, then, figures which can be assigned to four things:
the mental state on an acute basis and the mental state on a general,
average basis, and the physical being on an acute basis and the
physical being on a general basis. In Dianetics, we do not much
employ the physical Tone Scale. The mental Tone Scale, however,
is of vast and vital importance!
These values of happiness, bearable existence, anger and apathy
are not arbitrary values. They are deduced from observation of
the behavior of  emotional states. A Clear is usually found varying
around Tone , plus or minus in an average day. He is a general


BOOK ONE a CHAPTER THREE
Tone , which is one of  the inherent conditions of  being Clear.
A norm in current society, at a wild guess, is probably around a
general Tone ..
In this descriptic graph, which is two-dimensional, the vital data
for the solution of the problem of the life dynamic are workably
combined.The horizontal lines are in tenus of geometric progression
beginning with the zero line immediately above death. There are
ten lines for each zone and each zone denotes a mental or physical
state of  being, as noted. Geometric progression, so used, leaves
ever-increasing spaces between the lines. The width of this space is
the survival potential existing at the moment the top point of the
survival dynamic arrow is within thatspace. The further away from
death the top point of the survival dynamic arrow is, the better
chance the individual has of survival. Geometric progression reaches
up toward the impossible of infinity and cannot, of  course, reach
infinity. The organism is surviving through time from left to right.
Survival optimum-immortality-lies in tenus of time to the right.
Potential only is measured vertically.
The survival dynamic actually resides within the organism as
inherited from the species. The organism is part of the species as
a railroad tie might be said to be part of  a railroad as seen by an
observer on a train, the observer being always in "now"- although
this analogy is not perhaps the best.
Within itself, the organism possesses a repulsive force toward
pain sources. The source of the pain is not a driving force any more
than the thorn bush which tears the hand was a driving force; the
organism repulses the potential pain of a thorn.
At the same time, the organism has atwork a force which attracts
it to the sources of  pleasure. Pleasure does not magnetize the
organism into drawing near. Itis the organism which possesses the
attraction force. Itis inherent.
The repulsion of pain sources adds to the attraction for pleasure
sources to operate as a combined thrust away from death and toward
immortality. The thrust away from death is no more powerful

The GOAL of MAN
than the thrust toward immortality. In other words, in tenns of the
survival dynamic, pleasure has as much validity as pain.
It should not be read here that survival is always a matter of
keeping an eye on the future. Contemplation of  pleasure, pure
enjoyment, contemplation of  past pleasures, all combine into
harmonies which, while they operate automatically as a rise toward
the survival potential by their action within the organism physically,
do not demand the future as an active portion of  the mental
computation in such contemplation.
A pleasure which reacts to injure the body physically, as in the
case of debauchery, discovers at work a ratio between the physical
effect (which is depressed toward pain) and the mental effect of
experienced pleasure. There is a consequent lowering of the survival
dynamic. Averaging out, the future possibility of strain because of
the act, added to the state of being at the moment the debaucherywas
experienced, again depresses the survival dynamic. Because of this,
various kinds of debauchery have been in indifferent odor with Man
throughout his history. This is the equation of "immoral pleasures."
And any action which has brought about survival suppression or
which can bring it about, when pursued as a pleasure, has been
denounced atsome time or another in Man's history. Immorality is
originally hung as a label upon some act or class of actions because
they depress the level of the survival dynamic. Future enforcement
of moral stigma may depend largely upon prejudice and aberration
and there is, consequently, a continuous quarrel over what is moral
and what is immoral.
Because certain things practiced as pleasures are actually
pains-and how easy itwill be to trace out whywhen you've finished
this volume-and because of the moral equation as above, pleasure
itself, in any aberrated society, can become decried. A certain kind
of  thinking, of  which more, later, permits poor differentiation
between one object and another. Confusing a dishonest politician
with all politicians would be an example of this. In ancient times the
Roman was fond of  his pleasures and some of the things he called


BOOK ONE a CHAPTER THREE
pleasure were a trifle strenuous on other species such as Christians.
When the Christian overthrew the pagan state, the ancient order
of  Rome was in a villain's role. Anything, therefore, which was
Roman was villainous. This went to such remarkable lengths that
the Roman love of  bathing made bathing so immoral that Europe
went unwashed for some fifteen hundred years. The Roman had
become a pain source so general that everything Roman was evil
and itstayed evil long after Roman paganism perished. ImmoraIit}r,
in such a fashion, tends to become an involved subject. In this case
it became so involved that pleasure itselfwas stigmatized.
When half the survival potential is struck from the list of
lawful things, there is a considerable reduction in survival indeed.
Considering this graph on a racial scale, the reduction of survival
potential by one-halfwould forecast that direful things lay in wait
for the race. Actually, because Man is after all Man, no set of
laws, however enforced, can completely wipe away the attraction
of  pleasure. But in this case, enough WItS removed and banned to
occasion precisely what happened: the DarkAges and the recession
of society. Society brightened only in those periods such as the
Renaissance in which pleasure became less unlawful.
When a race or an individual drops into the second zone, as
marked on the chart, and the general tone ranges from the first
zone barely into the third, a condition of insanity ensues. Insanity
is irrationality. It is also a state in which non-survival has been so
closelyapproached continuallythat the race orthe organism engages
in all manner of wild solutions.
In further interpretation of this descriptic graph, there is the
matter of the survivalsuppressor. This, it will be seen, is a thrust
downward out of  potential immortality at the race or organism
represented as the survival dynamic. The survival suppressor is
the combined and variable threats to the survival of  the race or
organism. These threats come from otherspecies, from time, from
other energies. These are also engaged in the contest of survival to



The GOAL OrMAN
potential immortality in terms of  their own species or identities.
Thus there is a conflict involved. Every other fonn of life or energy
could be plotted in a descriptic as the Sltrvival dynamic. Ifwe were
to use a duck's survival dynamic in a descriptic graph, we would see
the duck seeking a high Sltrvivallevel and Man would be a part of
the duck's suppressor.
The balance and nature of things do not permit the infinity of
the goal of immortality to be reached. In fluctuating balance and
in almost unlimited complexity; life and energies ebb and flood out
of the nebulous, into fonns and, through decay, into the nebulous
once more.* Many equations could be drawn concerning this, but
it is outside the sphere of our present interest.
In terms of the zones of the descriptic, it is of relative concern
what the extent of the force of the suppressor is against the survival
dynamic. The dynamic is inherent in individuals, groups and races,
evolved to resist the suppressor through the eons. In the case of
Man, he carries with him another level of  of fensive and defensive
techniques: his cultures. His primary technology of survival is
mental activity governing physical action in the sentient echelon.
But every life form has its own technology, formed to resolve
the problems of food, protection and procreation. The degree of
workability of the technology any life form develops (armor or
brains, fleetness of foot or deceptive form) is a direct index of the
survival potential, the relative immortality, of that form. There
have been vast upsets in the past: Man, when he developed into the
world's most dangerous animal (he can and does kill or enslave any
life form, doesn't he?), overloaded the suppressor on many other
life forms and they dwindled in number or vanished.
A great climatic change, such as the one which packed so many
mammoths in Siberian ice, may overload the suppressor on a life
form. Along drought in the American Southwest in not too ancient
times wiped out the better part of an Indian civilization.
*The Veda; also Lucretius' Natllre of TbiTlgs.



BOOK ONE  CHAPTER THREE
A cataclysm such as an explosion of the core of the Earth, ifthat
were possible, orthe atom bomb or the sudden cessation of burning
on the Sun would wipe out all life forms on Earth.
And a life form can even overload the suppressor on itself. A
dinosaur destroys all hisfood and so destroys the dinosaur. Abubonic
plague bacillus attacks its hosts with such thorough appetite that the
whole generation of Pasteurella pestis vanishes. Such things are not
intended by the suicide to be suicide: the life form has run up against
an equation which has an unknown variable, and the unknown
variable unfortunately contained enough value to overload the
suppressor. This is the "didn't know the gun was loaded" equation.
And ifthe bubonic plague bacillus overloads its own suppressor in
an area and then ceases to trouble its food and shelter (the animals),
then the animals consider themselves benefited.
Reckless and clever and well-nigh indestructible, Man has led a
course which is a far cry from "tooth and claw" in every sphere. And
so have the redwood tree and the shark.Just as a life form, Man,
like every life form, is "symbiotic." Life is a group effort. Lichens
and plankton and algae may do very well on sunlight and minerals
alone, but they are the building blocks. Above such existence, as
the forms grow more complex, a tremendousinterdependence exists.
It is very well for a forester to believe that certain trees willfully
kill all other varieties of trees around them and then conclude a
specious "attitude" of trees. Let him look again. What made the
soil? What provides the means of  keeping the oxygen balance?
What makes it possible for rain to fall in other areas? These willful
and murderous trees. And squirrels plant trees. And Man plants
trees. And trees shelter trees of another kind. And animals fertilize
trees. And trees shelter animals. And trees hold the soil so less
well-rooted plants can grow. Look anywhere and everywhere and
we see life as an assist for life. The multitude of the complexities
of life as affinities for life is not dramatic. But they are the steady,
practical, important reason life can continue to exist at all.

The GOAL OrMAN
A redwood tree may be first outfor redwood trees and although
it does an excellent job of seeming to exist as redwood alone, a closer
glance will show it has dependencies and is depended upon.
Therefore, the dynamic of any life form can be seen to be assisted
by many other dynamics and combines with them against the
suppressive factors. None survive alone.
Necessity has been declared to be a very wonderful thing. But
necessity is a word which has been taken rather loosely for granted.
Opportunismseemsto have been read largely into necessity. What is
necessity? Besides being the "mother of invention," is it a dramatic,
sudden thingwhich excuses wars and murders, which touches a man
only when he is about to starve? Or is necessity a much gentler and
less dramatic quantity? "Everything," according to Leucippus, "is
driven by necessity." This is a keynote of much theorizing down
through the ages. Driven, that is the key to the error. Driven, things
are driven. Necessity drives. Pain drives. Necessity and pain, pain
and necessity.
Recalling the ·dramaticand overlooking the important, Man has
conceived himself, from time to time, to be an object of  chase by
necessity and pain. These were two anthropomorphic (manlike)
things which, in full costume, stuck spears at him. It can be said
to be a wrong concept merely because it does not work to produce
more answers.
Whatever there is of necessity is within him. Nothing is driving
him except his original impetus to survive. And he carries that
within himselfor his group. Within him is the force with which he
fends of fpain. Within himisthe force with which he attracts pleasure.
It chances to be a scientific fact that Man is a self-determined
organism to the outermost limit that any form of life can be, for he
still depends upon other forms of life and his general environment.
But he is self-determined. This is a matter which will be covered
later. Butright here it is necessary to indicate that he is not inherently
a determined organism in the sense that he is driven on this
wonderful stimulus-response basis which looks so neat in certain


BOOK ONE a CHAPTER THREE
textbooks and works so completely unworkably in the world of
Man. The happy little illustrations about rats do not serve when
we are talking about Man. The more complex the organism, the
less reliably the stimulus-response equation works. And when
one reaches that highest complexity, Man, he has reached a fine
degree of  variability in terms of stimulus-response. The more
sentient, the more rational an organism, the more that organism
is self-determined. Self-determinism, like all things, is relative.
Compared to a rat, however, Man is very self-determined indeed.
This is only a scientific fact because it can easily be proven.
The more sentient the man, the less he is a "push-button"
instrument. Aberrated and reduced, he can, of  course, in a limited
degree, be made to perform like a marionette; but then it is
understood that the more aberrated a person is, the closer he
approaches the intelligence quotient of  an animal.
Given this self-determinism, it is interesting to observe what
a man does with it. While he can never escape the "didn't know
it was loaded" equation in terms of  cataclysm or the unexpected
gain of some other life form, he operates in a high zone level of
survival potential. But here he is, self-determined, rational, his
primary weapon, his mind, in excellent working order. What are
his necessity instincts?
Necessity, according to that very sentient if rapidly
subject-changing article, the dictionary, is "the state of  being
necessary; that which is unavoidable; compulsion." It also adds
that necessity is "extreme poverty," but we don't want that. We are
talking aboutsurvival.
The compulsion mentioned can be re-evaluated in terms of the
survival dynamic. Thatis interior in the organism and the race. And
what is "necessary" to survival?
We have seen and can prove clinically that there are two factors
at work. The necessity of avoiding pain is a factor because, degree
by degree, little things, not much in themselves, can amount to
large pains which, compounded in thatrapid geometric progression,

The GOAL of MAN
bring on death. Pain is the sadness of  being bawled out for poor
work, because that may lead to being fired, which may lead to
starvation, which may lead to death. Run any equation into which
pain has entered and it can be seen that it reduces down to possible
non-survival. And if this were all there were to surviving and if
necessitywere a vicious little gnome with a pitchfork, itseems rather
obvious that there would be scant reason to go on living. But there
is the other part of the equation: pleasure. Thatis a more stable part
than pain, Stoics to the contrary, as clinical tests in Dianetics prove.
There is therefore a necessity for pleasure, for working, as
happiness can be defined, toward known goals over not unknowable
obstacles. And the necessity for pleasure is such that a great deal of
pain can be borne to attain it. Pleasure is the positive commodity.
It is enjoyment of work, contemplation of  deeds well done; it is a
good book or a good friend; it is taking all the skin of f one's knees
climbing the Matterhorn; it is hearing the kid first say daddy; it
is a brawl on the Bund at Shanghai or the whistle of  amour from
a doorway; it's adventure and hope and enthusiasm and "someday
I'll learn to paint"; it's eating a good meal or kissing a pretty girl
or playing a stiff game of  bluff on the stock exchange. It's what
Man does that he enjoys doing; it's what Man does that he enjoys
contemplating; it's what Man does that he enjoys remembering;
and it may be just the talk of things he knows he'll never do.
Man will endure a lot of  pain to obtain a little pleasure. Out in
the laboratory of the world, it takes very little time to confirm that.
And how does necessity fit this picture? There is a necessity for
pleasure, a necessity as live and quivering and vital as the human
heart itself. He who said that a man who had two loaves of  bread
should sell one to buy white hyacinth, spoke sooth. The creative,
the constructive, the beautiful, the harmonious, the adventurous,
yes, and even escape from the maw of  oblivion, these things are
pleasure and these things are necessity. There was a man once who
had walked a thousand miles just to see an orange tree and another


BOOK ONE a CHAPTER THREE
who was a mass of scars and poor-set bones who was eager just to
get a chance to "fan another bronc."
It is very well to dwell in some Olympian height and write a
book of penalties and very well to read to find whatwriterssaid that
other writers said, but it is not very practical.
The pain-drive theory does not work. Ifsome of these basics
of Dianetics were only poetry about the idyllic state of Man, they
might be justified in that. But it happens that out in the laboratory
of the world, they work.
Man, in affinity with Man, survives. And that survival is
pleasure. Q

BOOK ONE, CHAPTER FOUR

The FOUR DYNAMICS

INTHE ORIGINAL equations of Dianetics, when the research was
young, it was believed thatsurvival could be envisioned in personal
tenns alone and still answer all conditions. A theory is only as good
as it works. And it works as well as it explains observed data and
predicts new material which will be found, in fact, to exist.
Survival in personal terms was computed until the whole activity
of  Man could be theoretically explained in terms of self alone.
The logic looked fairly valid. But then it was applied to the world.
Somethingwas wrong: it did notsolve problems. In fact, the theory
of survival in personal terms alone was so unworkable that it left
a majority of  behavior phenomena unexplained. But it could be
computed and it still looked good.
Then it was that a nearly intuitive idea occurred. Man's
understanding developed in ratio to his recognition of  his
brotherhood with the Universe. That was high flown, but it yielded
results.
Was Man himself a brotherhood of Man? He had evolved and
become strong as a gregarious being, an animal that hunted in packs.

BOOK ONE a CHAPTER FOUR
Itseemed possible that all his activities could be computed in terms
of the survival of the group. That computation was made. It looked
good. Man survived, itwas postulated, solelyin terms of the survival
of  his group. It looked good, but it left a majority of  observed
phenomena unexplained.
It was attempted, then, to explain Man's behavior in terms of
Mankind alone, which isto say, itwas assumed thatMankind survived
for Mankind in a highly altruistic way. This was straight down the
sylvan path of Jean Jacques Rousseau. It could be computed that
Man lived alone for the survival of all Mankind. Butwhen addressed
to the laboratory-the world-it did not work.
Finally, it was recalled that some had thought that Man's entire
activity and all his behavior could be explained by assuming that he
lived for sex alone. This was not an original assumption. Butsome
original computations were made upon it and it is true that, by a
few quick twists of the equation, his survival activity can be made
to resolve on only the sexual basis. But when this was applied to
observed data, again it failed to explain every phenomenon.
An examination was made of what had been attempted. It had
been assumed thatMan survived only for himselfas an individual; it
had been computed that he survived only for the group, the pack, for
society; it had been postulated that he survived only for Mankind;
and finally, it had been theorized that he lived only for sex. None
worked alone.
A new computation was made on the survival dynamic. Exactly
for what was Man surviving? All four of these factors, self, sex, group
and Mankind, were entered into a new equation. And now it was
found, a theorywas in hand which worked. It explained all observed
phenomena and it predicted new phenomena which were discovered
to exist. It was a scientific equation, therefore!
From the survival dynamic, in this fashion, were evolved the
four dynamics. By survival dynamic was meant the basic command
"SURVIVE!" which underlay all activity. By dynamic was meant
one of the four purpose divisions of the entire dynamic principle.

The FOUR DYNAMICS
The four dynamics were not new forces, they were subdivisions of
the primary force.
DYNAMIC ONE is the urge toward ultimate survival on
the part of the individual and for himself. It includes his
immediate symbiotes,* the extension of culture for his own
benefit and name immortality.
DYNAMIC TWO is the urge of the individual toward ultimate
survival via the sex act, the creation of  and the rearing
of  children. It includes their symbiotes, the extension of
culture for them and their future provision.
DYNAMIC TH REE is the urge of  the individual toward
ultimate survival for the group. It includes the symbiotes
of the group and the extension of its culture.
DYNAMIC FOUR includes the urge of the individual toward
ultimate survival for all Mankind. It includes the symbiotes
of Mankind and the extension of its culture.
Life, the atom and the universe and energy itself are included
under the symbiotic classification.
Itwill be seen immediately that these four dynamics are actually
a spectrum without sharp division lines. The survival dynamic
can be seen to sweep out from the individual to embrace the entire
species and its symbiotes.
None of these dynamics is necessarily stronger than any of the
others. Each is strong. They are the four roads a man takes to
survival. And the four roads are actually one road. And the one road
is actually a spectrum of thousands of roads contained within the
four. They are all in terms of  past, present and future in that the
present may be a sum of the past and the future may be the product
of the past and present.
"The Dianetic meaning of symbiote is extended beyond the dictionary definition to
mean "any or all life or energy forms which are mutually dependent for survival."
The atom depends on the Universe, the Universe on the atom.



BOOK ONE Q CHAPTER FOUR
All the purposes of Man can be considered to lie within this
spectrum and all behavior becomes explained.
That Man is selfish is a valid statement when one means an
aberratedMan. ThatMan is antisocial is an equally valid statement
if one adds the modifier, aberration. And other such statements
resolve equally.
Nowithappensthat these four dynamics can be seen to compete,
one with another, in their operation within an individual or a societ}'.
There is a rational reason for this. The phrase "social competition"
is a compound of aberrated behavior and sentient difficulties.
Any man, group or race may be in contest with any race, group
or man and even in contest with sex on an entirely rationalleveI.
The Equation of the Optimum Solution would be that aproblem
hasbeen wellresolvedwhich portendsthe maximumgoodforthe maximum
numberof dynamics.That is to say that any solution, modified by the
time available to put the solution into effect, should be creative or
constructive for the greatest possible number of  dynamics. The
optimum solution for any problem would be a solution which
achieved the maximum benefit in all the dynamics. This means
that a man, determining upon some project, would fare best if he
benefited everything concerned in the four dynamics as his project
touched them. He would then have to benefit himself, as well, for the
solution to be optimum. In otherwords, the benefiting of the Group
and Mankind Dynamics, but the blocking of the Sex Dynamic and
the SelfDynamicwould be much poorerthan the bestsolution. The
conductsurvivalpattern is built upon this Equation of the Optimum
Solution. It is the basic equation of  all rational behavior and is the
equation on which a Clear functions. It is inherent in Man.
In other words, the best solution to any problem is that which
will bring the greatest good to the greatest number of  beings,
including self, progeny, family associates, political and racial groups,
and at length to all Mankind. The greatest good may require, as
well, some destruction, but the solution deteriorates in a ratio to
the destructiveness employed. Self-sacrifice and selfishness are


The FOUR DYNAMICS
alike reductive of the optimum action equation and alike have been
suspected and should be.
This is entirely a matter of : does itwork? Even on an unaberrated
basis, there are times when one or another of these dynamics has
to be dropped from the computation of some activity or other and,
indeed, few problems are so entirely intense that they must take
into account all the dynamics. But when a problem achieves such
intensity, and time is not an important factor, serious errors can
follow the omission of  one or another of  the dynamics from the
factors considered.
In the case of a Napoleon "saving France" at the expense of the
remainder of Mankind in Europe, the Equation of the Optimum
Solution wasso far neglected that all the revolutionary gains of the
French people were lost. In the case of Caesar "saving Rome," the
equation was so poorly done that the survival of Rome was impeded.
But there are special cases when the Equation of the Optimum
Solution becomes so involved with time that certain dynamics must
be neglected to permit other dynamics to persist. The case of a sailor
giving his own life to save his ship answers the Group Dynamic.
Such an action is a valid solution to a problem. But it violates the
optimttm solution because it did not answer for Dynamic One: self.
Many examples of various kinds could be cited where one or
another of the dynamics must, of  necessity, receive priority, all on
an entirely rational basis.
On an aberrated basis the equation is still valid, but complicated
by irrationalities which have no part of the situation. Many solutions
are bad merely because of false educational data or no data at all.
But these are still solutions. In the case of  aberrated solutions, the
dynamics are actually and actively impeded, as will later be outlined
in full.



BOOK ONE, CHAPTER FIVE

SUMMARY

THE DYNAMIC Principle of Existence is SURVIVAL.
This survival can be graduated into four zones, each one
progressively portending a better opportunity of  reaching the
potential of immortality. Zone  borders from death and includes
apathy; Zone  borders from apathy and includes violent effort;
Zone  borders from violence into mediocre but not entirely
satisfactory success; Zone  borders from the mediocre to the
excellent chance. These zones are each occasioned by the ratio
of  the s'ltppressor to the survival dynamic. In apathy, Zone , the
suppressor appears too great to be overcome. In the area of
violence, Zone , the suppressor more or less overbalances the
survival dynamic, requiring enormous effort which, when expended
without result, drops the organism into the  Zone. In the area
of  mediocrity, Zone , the suppressor and the survival dynamic
are more or less evenly balanced. In the area of  Zone , the
survival dynamic has overcome the suppressor and, the chances of
survival being excellent, is the area of  high response to problems.



BOOK ONE Q CHAPTER FIVE
These four zones might be classed as the zone of no hope, the zone
of  violent action, the area of  balance and the area of  high hope.
Clinical experiment is the basis of these zones, since they follow a
progress of mental or physical being as it rises from the death area
into high existence.
The four dynamics are subdivisions of the survival dynamic and
are, in Mankind, the thrust toward potential survival in terms of
entities. They embrace all the purposes, activities and behavior
of Mankind. They could be said to be a conduct survival pattern.
The first of  these, but not necessarily the most important nor
yet the one which will receive priority in various efforts, is the
Individual Dynamic, DYNAMIC ONE, which includes the personal
survival of the individual as a living person and the survival of  his
personal symbiotes. DYNAMIC TWO is the thrust toward potential
immortality through children and includes all sexual activity as
well as the symbiotes of the children. DYNAMIC THREE is survival
in terms of  the group, which term may include such things as a
club, a military company, a city, a state, a nation; this would include
the symbiotes of the group. DYNAMIC FOUR is the thrust toward
potential immortality of Mankind as a species and the symbiotes
of Mankind. Embraced within these classifications are any part of
existence, any form of matter and, indeed, the Universe.
Any problem orsituation discoverable within the activities or
purposes of Mankind is embraced within these dynamics.
The Equation of the Optimum Solution is inherent within the
organism and, modified by education or viewpoint and modified
further by time, is the operating method of unaberrated ~ndividuals,
groups or Mankind. The Equation of  the Optimum Solution is
always present even in severely aberrated individuals and is used
as modified by their education, viewpoint and available time. The
aberration does not remove activity from the dynamics of survival.
Aberrated conduct isirrationalsurvival conduct and isfully intended
to lead to survival. That the intent is not the act does not eradicate
the intent.
